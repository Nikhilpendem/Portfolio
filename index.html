      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm a passionate QA and full-stack enthusiast with hands-on experience in both testing and development. 
        I've worked on testing REST APIs using Pytest and Postman, as well as mobile applications using Appium. 
        I also bring solid experience in web testing with Selenium WebDriver, scripting in Python to ensure quality across platforms.
        In addition to testing, I enjoy building web applications. I'm familiar with frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
        and I've been working on a project using React.js for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend, integrating ORM for efficient data handling.
        I'm always eager to learn new tools and technologies, and I enjoy turning ideas into real, functional products that perform well and are easy to use.</p>

        performance of backend services. Also performed mobile application testing using Appium on Android devices, focusing on functional
         and regression testing. Actively collaborated with the development team to report, track, and verify bugs, contributing to the
